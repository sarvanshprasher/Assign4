- This ios application displays the list of all the places according to their categories(Hiking,Adventure,School) .

- Places can be added, updated, deleted from JsonRPC server as well as from Core Data present inside the application.

- On clicking on any place, it takes you to the place detail page where you will be seeing basic information about that
specific place.

- Distance between two places can also be measured based on their latitude and longitude information. We are calcuating these distances using this reference http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html
